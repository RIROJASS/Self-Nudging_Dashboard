Once you paste that into GitHub, let me know and we’ll jump into **Phase 2**:  
🧾 *Tracking inputs* (your actions, habits, or moods) **right from the dashboard**.

Would you like to do that with:
- 📋 a simple in-page **text input field**, or  
- 📂 logging to a file or localStorage for future analysis?

Let’s keep building!
